       Data visualization is frequently used in Digital Humanities for exploration,
				analysis, to make an argument, or to grapple with large-scale data. Increasing
				access to off-the-shelf data visualization tools is beneficial to the field, but it
				can lead to facile and homogenized visualizations.</p>
			<p>
				<span>Data physicalization can be used to defamiliarize and
					refresh the insight that data visualizations initially brought to DH.
					Proliferation in 3D modeling software and relatively affordable 3D printing
					technology makes iterative, computer-generated data physicalization more
					feasible. Working in three dimensions gives additional affordances: parallel
					data series can be seen next to each other, rather than color-coded, overlapped,
					or staggered; and physical objects can be viewed from multiple angles, allowing
					for changing perspective.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Data visualization necessarily privileges sight.
					Explorations into other senses, such as data sonification and physicalization
					provide new venues of experience. Touch is particularly significant, since it is
					the only meta-sense other than sight and because of the intimacy it affords, per
					the thought of feminist philosopher Luce Irigaray. Multimodal data explorations
					incorporating touch and sound can provide new possibilities of accessibility to
					those with low vision (for example, see the </span>

				</a>
				<span> project). Spatial, acoustic, and temporal dimensions
					of data representation can generate rich narratives, invite the audience to
					explore new relationships, and turn passive consumption into a sensory
					experience that encourages interpretation, and challenge the reductive nature of
					data visualization. In addition, creating data physicalizations can be a form of
					critical making; the iterative and reflective process requires more time to
					engage with the data, including the human aspects represented.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As an alternative approach to the rhetoric of
					“building” or “making” that has become common in DH, we are inspired by the work
					of Lauren Klein and Catherine D’Ignazio, who encourage a reorientation toward
					the emotional and affective qualities in our engagement with data. In employing
					physicalization as a technique to corporealize and “re-humanize” humanities
					data, we follow the ethical principles articulated by the Colored Conventions
					Project to “contextualize and narrate the conditions of the people who appear as
					‘data’ and to name them when possible.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We propose a multi-media installation consisting of
					data physicalization objects and dynamic displays to be exhibited at the
					conference poster session concurrently with an explanatory poster. Pieces in the
					installation will utilize space, time, and/or interaction to provide new ways of
					engaging with a dataset and the arguments and narratives behind it, in order to
					challenge the dominant paradigms of conventional screen-based data
					visualization. Each piece will have an accompanying statement on the poster
					documenting the humanities data and projects it draws on and the significance or
					insights of the design. Pieces will be designed as much as possible to
					accommodate display in a space alongside the poster. If individual pieces are
					unable to be transported to or exhibited at the poster session, the poster will
					still serve as a proxy for understanding the ways they subvert traditional
					paradigms of data visualization.</span>
			</p>
			<p>Provisional list of pieces:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="item">experience a well-known work of philosophy through a threaded
					representation of citation networks and references woven on a loom.</li>
				<li class="item">interact with a physical manifestation of membership data for a
					famous lending library by pulling apart its two main archival sources in three
					dimensions.</li>
				<li class="item">discover patterns in borrowing activity of lesser-known members of
					the same library by folding printed data into a paper model.</li>
