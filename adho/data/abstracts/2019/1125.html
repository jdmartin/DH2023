			<p>Scholars, researchers, and advocates of linked open data from the humanities and GLAM community are invited to participate in a half-day workshop, “Ontologies for Linked Data in the Humanities”, to take place prior to the start of Digital Humanities 2019, probably July 7th, in Utrecht, Netherlands. We are soliciting short papers (up to 2000 words) related to ontologies. </p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:1A1A1A">Those accepted will be circulated in an open-access online collection in advance of the workshop. (See collection for 2017 workshop here: </span>

			</p>
			<p>Selected contributors who are attending the workshop will be invited to give short presentations (5-10 mins) that will form the basis for discussion and debate.</p>
			<p>Please note: If you are unable to attend DH2019 but would still like to contribute a paper to this open source resource, please fill in the form at the link below (it will ask you if you are attending). This link will remain open after the workshop call is complete to collect further contributions. </p>

				<li class="item">Application and extension of standards such as Web Annotation, IIIF, and CIDOC-CRM to solve challenges of digital representation or to support novel forms of analysis</li>
				<li class="item">Strategies for combining ontologies</li>
				<li class="item">Challenges of linking incommensurate vocabularies or ontologies</li>
				<li class="item">
					<span style="color:1A1A1A">Modules, suites, and other strategies for promoting the uptake of ontologies in large or interconnected domains</span>
				</li>
				<li class="item">Principles of ontology organization and architecture</li>
				<li class="item">Tensions between simplicity and complexity or nuance</li>
				<li class="item">Revision, management, versioning, and usage of dynamic ontologies</li>
				<li class="item">Impacts of particular ontologies on discoverability, visualization, or analysis</li>
				<li class="item">Reviews or overviews of generic tools for managing, versioning, or publishing ontologies</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<span style="font-weight:bold;color:1A1A1A">Paper submissions are due May 13th</span>
				<span style="color:1A1A1A">, after which the conference program committee will review them and notify potential participants, with a schedule of presentations, no later than June 7th.

					<span style="color:1155CC">Advancing Linked Open Data in the Humanities</span>
				</a>
				<span style="color:1A1A1A">. We intend to publish the 2019 collection of short papers in a similar format in advance of the workshop.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:1A1A1A">Short papers should be submitted using </span>
