				</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">Is an animal a person? The question is far from idle; it is in fact fraught with urgent ethical and legal consequences for both animal and environmental rights and shapes scientific norms for the study of animal behavior. It remains a constant theme in Western philosophy from Rene Descartes through present-day Critical Animal Studies. However, lawyers, philosophers, and ethologists are not the only deciders in this question: cultural representations of animals also mediate their relation to personhood. Fiction, for instance, excels in the representation of human individuality, interiority, and action; complex, “round” characters of course populate the long history of prose fiction. How, then, does fiction engage with the personhood of animals? In fiction, is an animal a 
            <span style="font-style:italic">character</span>
        
        ? What do animals do in the pages of fiction? Do they make decisions, have feelings, express interiority? Do animals function more similarly to human characters, or to things, objects, and machines?
      </p>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">In what follows, we approach these questions with computational methods in one of the first attempts to apply digital methods to animal studies.

         In a variety of corpora—from popular natural history to scientific writing about animal behavior to animal-driven fictions historically accused of anthropomorphism—we compare the semantic and syntactic footprints left behind by animals and humans. We discover that, from a computational standpoint, animals in fiction are indeed recognizable as characters, albeit characters who register intentionality through physical movement over speech and display a mental paradigm delimited by instinct and associative learning. Natural history writing, on the other hand, narrates animals in ways that seem surprisingly human-like when compared to animal representations in fiction more broadly.

				</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">Around the turn of the twentieth century, reading audiences in the United States developed a penchant for fiction about nonhuman animals. These so-called “wild animal stories” appeared in popular magazines and short story collections by writers such as E.T. Seton, Charles G.D. Roberts, William J. Long and Jack London. Despite their popularity, the stories proved to be a flash-point for scientific controversy over the appropriate way to narrate animal behavior. Over a period of several years, prominent public intellectuals—including the naturalist John Burroughs and then-president Teddy Roosevelt—would attack the writers of wild animal stories for attributing inaccurately human-like qualities to their nonhuman characters. The entire debate would come to be known as “The Nature Fakers” episode. 
            <span id="ftn2_return">

							<sup>2</sup>
						</a>
					</span>
        
         Though concerned a minor and moderately pulpy literary sub-genre, the controversy marks a moment when science and fiction butt heads over the meaning and appropriateness of anthropomorphism, as natural historians attempt to police the limits of fictional character. This corpus thus offers a high-stakes proving ground for the very concept of anthropomorphism in narrative fiction and science writing.
      </p>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">We have assembled 54 texts from the writers involved in this controversy, comprising short story collections and novels by eight of the most prominent animal story authors, published between the 1870s and the 1930s and concentrated in the first two decades of the twentieth century when the Nature Fakers debate was at its most intense. As a point of comparison for these fictions, we have also assembled 17 of John Burroughs’ natural history monographs, which detail the doings of wild animals in the idiom of popular science. Finally, we selected approximately 400 American novels published between 1870 and 1930 as a control corpus with no particular interest in nonhuman animals.

					<span class="head">Methods</span>
				</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">Our digital methods collect the words that characterize animals, humans, objects in fiction. We base our methods on BookNLP, a Java program which clusters fictional character names together (“Elizabeth” and “Elizabeth Bennet”), and then collects the words associated with each character in specific ways: verbs for which each character is either a subject (“Elizabeth wondered”) or an object (“Mrs. Gardiner ... reminded Elizabeth”); as well as the nouns each character possesses (“Elizabeth’s wishes”), the adjectives attributed to each character (“Elizabeth was watchful”), and all words spoken by the character in moments of dialogue.

							<sup>4</sup>
						</a>
					</span>
        
         We applied BookNLP to our corpus of wild animal stories, and then annotated its returned characters for whether they were human or animal in 15 of the cleanest texts. BookNLP was in general accurate at identifying named animal characters—for example, in London’s 
            <span style="font-style:italic">White Fang</span>
        
        , BookNLP failed to recognize only one repeatedly occurring named character, White Fang’s father One Eye. The results of our annotations are recorded below in Table 1.

					<span style="font-family:EB Garamond;font-size:10pt">. Statistics regarding the small corpus of 15 texts whose BookNLP-identified characters have been annotated for their species (whether human or animal). Sorted by the number of stories they contribute, these authors vary widely in the number of word-to-character associations they generate. For instance, although William Long contributes more stories, words, and characters than Jack London, his effect on the aggregate data is smaller (6% to London’s 35%): this is because he attributes on average only 56 words per character, whereas London attributes on average 199 words to each character. This is likely owing to Long’s heavier usage of non-proper nouns, often referring to characters as “the mother,” “the cub,” etc.</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">BookNLP has the obvious limitation of overlooking unnamed characters—both human and animal alike. To address this limitation, we designed a Python program to extend BookNLP’s logic to all nouns. Our program collected approximately the same information: the verbs of which each noun is a subject or object; the nouns it possesses; and the adjectives it is modified by.

				<p style="text-align:left; ">Finally, to determine whether a word is (statistically) significantly more likely to associate with a human or animal character, we conduct a Fisher’s exact test on a 2x2 contingency table: (# of times a given word appears in the context of an animal/human character) x (# of times an animal / human character appears.) This weights our expectation for the number of times words appear by the number of times characters appear. The Fisher’s exact test returns an odds ratio (the odds of a word’s human association / its odds of animal association) along with a p-value. Words with a p-value of less than 0.1 are shown in the results below.</p>

					<p style="text-align:left; ">As seen in Figure 1, human characters are more likely to be the subject of speaking verbs such as “asked,” “called,” “cried,” “announced,” and, most especially, “answered.” Even in these wild animal stories, animals do not (as a rule) speak. Instead, animal characters in these texts are far more likely than humans to register intentional response through embodied activity--such verbs as “fought,” “bristled,” and “licked.” Emotionally, these results suggest that animals are characterized more by aggression (“hated”), humans by sociability (“love”).

           More subtly, animals “learn” and “know” things, while a human character is more likely to have “thought,” a result that could suggest something about the prevailing paradigm of animal mental life, characterized by instinct and associative learning, rather than rational reflection.

					<p style="text-align:left; ">Our comparison of Burroughs’ natural history writings with the Wild Animal Stories does not, on the face, suggest that animals are any less person-like in Burroughs anti-anthropomorphic paradigm than they are in fiction. Indeed, as seen in Figure 2 below, Burroughs’ animals are statistically more likely to “know,” “make,” and “become” than their fictional counterparts. Many of the most distinctive active verbs between these two corpora might be explained by their relative interest in different species--for example, Burroughs writes about birds more frequently, so his animals are more likely to “fly” and “sing.” On the other hand, the strong influence of Jack London in the fictional corpus results in a high incidence of sled dogs, who are statistically more likely to “draw” a sled.</p>

Comparatively, when fiction with no particular interest in non-human animals is added to the mix, the computer was able to distinguish humans from animals with a median classification accuracy of 82%.

							<span> Our Python program ran the corpus through spaCy, a syntactic dependency parser for Python, and collected all moments when a noun had a syntactic relation to another word in a sentence of any of the following kinds (shown in parentheses are the syntactic dependency tags): subject (nsubj); passive subject (nsubjpass); direct and indirect objects (dobj and dative); possessives (poss); and modifiers (amod [adjective], compound [noun compound], appos [appositive], and attr [predicate]). We used SpaCy's default English-language model (en_core_web_sm), trained on web discourse. That this model was trained on the hyper-modern form of language of the internet is of course regrettable, given the historical material of our project, but unfortunately this is common and largely unavoidable problem in literary text mining.</span>
