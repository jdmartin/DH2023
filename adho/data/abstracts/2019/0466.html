         We combine natural language processing and spatial information technology to analyze the literary trajectory and geographical distribution of poets and their poems. Assisted by digital tools such as geographic information systems (GIS) which can manage and present spatial data, we can describe the connection and evolution between poets, poems and space.

					</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left; ">At this moment, we focus on poems that consist of five or seven-character lines because they are the majority in CTP. Table 1 shows the statistics for the poems in CTP.</p>
					<p style="text-align:left; ">In order to spatialize the literary materials, we extract the words that carry spatial attributes by marking words as place names at the step of part-of-speech (POS) tagging. Before that, we have to segment Chinese strings into words. Chinese word segmentation is a very difficult task for traditional poems, and the segmentation results have a considerable impact on the subsequent analysis. In addition to employing the CKIP segmenter (Ma and Chen, 2003), we also rely on some heuristics for Chinese segmentation that are applicable to traditional Chinese poems.</p>

        </p>
					<p style="text-align:left; ">Relying on a heuristic (Lo, 2005), we may segment a line of five characters in two ways: 212 and 221. For example, we can divide “奉命籌軍國” into “奉命-籌-軍國” (212) or “奉命-籌軍-國” (221). Similarly, we may segment a line with seven characters into two ways: 2212 or 2221, e.g., producing “昔日-東寧-今-豫章” (2212) or “昔日-東寧-今豫-章”(2221) from “昔日東寧今豫章”. Applying these heuristics with the CKIP segmenter, we segment the CTP poems. The CKIP segmenter also does POS tagging, and Nc is of the code for place names. We show some statistics about the place names in Table 2.</p>

					</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left; ">After the POS step, we filter the list of Nc words for unique place names. Figure 2 shows the distribution of lengths of these unique words.</p>
					<p style="text-align:left; ">After filtering the place names, we attempt to geocode the unique place names. The process of geocoding is shown in Figure 3. We do geocoding in two steps. First, we use the API of Chinese Civilization in Time and Space (CCTS API) provided by the Academia Sinica. 
              <span id="ftn2_return">

								<sup>2</sup>
							</a>
						</span>
          
           CCTS reports reliable spatial information for places in Taiwan and China. If we cannot find a location for a name via CCTS, we continue geocoding via the Google Map API.

						</span>
          
           We ignore names that cannot be geocoded by both services.

           Figure 3. Flowchart of the place name geocoding
        </p>
					<p style="text-align:left; ">Recall that the results of the word segmentation are not completely correct, so there may be some errors with geocoding. For instance, some place names are geocoded to other countries. To avoid these problems at this moment, we use a spatial processing method to eliminate the points outside Taiwan and China.</p>

It analyzes the distribution of poets in parts of Taiwan. It shows that the changing distribution densities of poets in Tainan (in the south), Taipei (in the north), and Changhua (in the middle) in these time periods. This may provide hints for studies of the socioeconomic developments and cultural activities of those years.</p>

					<p style="text-align:left; ">Splitting the 200 years of the Qing administration in Taiwan into four sub-periods, Figure 7 helps us see that some place names are more popular in different periods. Place names of the eastern part of Taiwan were mentioned less in the early Qing Dynasty. Scholars can discover more phenomena based on the spatial-temporal results, and interested scholars can certainly investigate the implications of the changing trends.</p>

During his middle age (37-46), he mentioned many places in Taiwan and Japan. In his older period (after 47), he mainly focused on Taiwan, occasionally mentioning the place names of China and Japan.

					<p style="text-align:left; ">We can find that poets may have some preferences for the place names in their works in different periods. Through the spatiotemporal analysis of the poets' trails, we may pursue deeper issues about the observations. Wang et al. have done similar analysis for Yu Yonghe (郁永河). (Wang et al., 2011)</p>

				</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">We analyzed the poets and poems in the Complete Taiwan Poems via GIS viewpoints. By combining the techniques of natural language processing and the methods of spatiotemporal analysis, we present information about poets and poems geographically. We demonstrate our ideas with three examples: a poet's trail, the distributions of poets’ birthplaces, and the distributions of place names in the poems. We hope that these cross-disciplinary explorative results may inspire fruitful ideas for literary research.</p>
