			<p style="text-align:left; ">Existing studies have demonstrated the potential of network analysis in extracting and visualizing complex information from large historical datasets (Larson 2013; Sun 2016). Art history, however, still dwells in the early stages of exploring how network methodologies can benefit its scholarship. The only applications of network analysis in art historical research often equate network to social network and borrows concepts and theories from the social sciences (Kok 2013; Brosen et al. 2016; Lincoln 2016, 2017). Digital art history calls for new concepts tailored to artistic networks in order to account for the developments of art in all its complexity. </p>
			<p style="text-align:left; ">This research conceptualizes a novel art historical network of ideas inscribed in the iconography, connecting artists not through social ties but shared subject matters. Through visualizing this conceptual network, this study tries to answer the following questions: how are artists connected through their choice of subject matters? Have the patterns of such connections changed over time? And more importantly, is the choice of subject matter related to the choice of painting style, location of residence, and timing of entering the market? To answer these questions, this study draws on large digital collections of Netherlandish paintings to construct a dynamic network model of iconography. This research foregrounds history paintings produced in the Low Countries between 1575 and 1700, an established genre which witnessed dramatic iconographical changes during this period (Sluijter 1991). The results of this study demonstrate the spatial and temporal evolution of the artists’ network of ideas, revealing the changes in the structures of artistic interactions and the diffusion patterns of subject matters within the artist community in different cities.</p>

         This database describes over 150,000 paintings within the scope of this study. In the absence of a mature image recognition technology that is able to discern a great variety of complicated subjects of the paintings, this research uses the iconographical notation system ICONCLASS, a hierarchically ordered system of unique alphanumeric classification codes with which most images in the RKD have been processed and tagged.

				</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">The network of ideas draws a connection between two artists through a mutual subject matter; the strength of the tie between them is measured by the total number of iconographical overlaps in their oeuvre. The record of a painting in the 
            <span style="font-style:italic">RKDImages</span>
        
         identifies a link between the painter (if attributed) and the subject (labeled with ICONCLASS). One painter can link to many subjects as he painted various scenes and one subject matter can tie to numerous painters who depicted it. Putting all the works of art and artists together, a two-mode network is constructed, which consists of two types of nodes: artists and subject matters.
      </p>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">The two-mode network of persons and subjects are then collapsed into two one-mode networks by converting one of the node types to an edge or link between nodes of the other type (Watts 2004; Hanneman and Riddle 2005; Knappett 2011). For artists who picked a particular subject matter, the subject becomes the conceptual edge connecting the two artist nodes, while a single artist who depicted two stories would be the edge between those two subject matters. In other words, the two-mode, artist-subject network is projected into 1) an artist-artist network, in which the link is constructed by the subject matters artists mutually depicted; and 2) a subject-subject network in which the link is drawn by the artists who painted both themes. I resort to graph theory to examine the nature and the properties of the network of ideas. Among the measurements, modularity is particularly relevant to art history as it helps us to identify clusters of artists that are more likely to paint the similar subject matter or groups of subjects that are more often co-existent in a single painter’s oeuvre. Modularity can help understand whether or not the thematic choice is related to the choices of other aspects of their work and life.</p>

					<p style="text-align:left; ">The structure of networks shown in Table 1 indicates an expansion in popular subject matters between 1610-1650, coinciding with higher interconnectivity seen in the network of artists. Astonishingly, although a greater variety of subject matters have been explored and popularized by the generation of masters who entered the market between 1610 and 1650, their successors fell back to a shrunken pool of subject matters and restrained their repertoire, which is reflected in the reduction of the number of nodes. This observation of the popularity of a limited number of subjects and the virtual absence of others in the evolution of the network of subject matters verifies the limited repertoire art historians suggested (Sluijter 2000; Bok 2001). Furthermore, a structural change is observed in the evolution of the network across time periods: the connections among the subjects depicted by painters entering the market after 1650 are more evenly distributed (Fig. 1c) and the network is less centralized, meaning the painter was likely to pick among the same pool of subjects instead of venturing into new iconographies.</p>

					<p style="text-align:left; ">The networks of ideas in Amsterdam, Haarlem, and Utrecht demonstrate unique characteristics: Amsterdam had higher modularity which loosely corresponds to different styles co-existing at the same time; Haarlem had a centralized network and a schism between generations, and Utrecht enjoyed the most densely woven networks of both artist and subject matters. The choice of subject matters shows certain preferences in each city, with Amsterdam venturing more into the new subjects popularized by innovators from Rembrandt’s teacher, Pieter Lastman, to Rembrandt, Haarlem demonstrating the legacy of Mannerism, and Utrecht embracing both old and new fashion in its oeuvre. </p>
					<p style="text-align:left; ">Amsterdam has the largest network among the three artistic centers. The high average path length and the relatively low clustering coefficient indicate a more hierarchical structure around key painters and the flow of artistic knowledge is likely to have trickled down from the great masters to their circle, then to the lower segments, instead of diffusing among the minor masters (Fig.2a). Amsterdam’s network is also the least centralized among the three (Table 2), suggesting that several masters formed their relatively independent circle of interaction. </p>
