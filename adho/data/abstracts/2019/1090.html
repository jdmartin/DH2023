			<p style="text-align:left; ">Lexicography is currently embracing rapid change as the traditional methods of publishing dictionaries are replaced by the ubiquity of lexical information on the Web. Furthermore, the application of computational techniques to the processes of lexicography is revolutionizing how dictionaries can be constructed. In this context, the recently established ELEXIS (European Lexicographic Infrastructure) project aims to develop an infrastructure for eLexicography across Europe, that builds a virtuous cycle of lexicography where lexicographic resources are linked across languages, in order to build improved natural language processing tools, which can then aid in the construction of novel resources and retro-digitization of dictionaries, thus driving the cycle. The project is multilingual, covering 15 European countries, and has a strong interest in driving lexicography for under-resourced and minoritized languages.</p>
			<p style="text-align:left; ">The event will be the second iteration of a highly successful 
          <a class="link_ref" href="https://lexdhai.insight-centre.org/">workshop first run</a>
      
       before the EADH Conference in Galway on 6 December 2018. On that occasion, the Workshop was the highest-subscribed of the ten pre-conference workshops, with 33 regular registrations and approximately fifty attendees from a range of backgrounds in lexicography, computer science, and the humanities.
    </p>
			<p style="text-align:left; ">Specific emphasis in this edition of the workshop will be on complexity in regard of data, technologies and community aspects of lexicography. Complexity in data concerns issues in access to lexicographic data across stakeholders (national institutes, research groups, individuals), representation formats, linguistic assumptions, underlying theories and scope of analysis and representation, legal restrictions and licenses, multilingual, cross-lingual, comparative and typological issues, as well as advanced aspects in multimodality, concerning audio-visual representation. Complexity in technologies concerns challenges in creating and expanding novel lexicographic resources, which require a combination of many technologies, including natural language processing tools as well as machine learning approaches and AI methods in general, for data linking and data management, in order to identify and represent words, their senses and definitions. </p>
			<p style="text-align:left; ">Complexity in communities, in part, lies in differences related to stakeholders’ type and status (national language institutes, standardization bodies, research groups, individuals), status of the language in question (official, minority, regional, etc.), and involvement in networking activities. In addition, the complexity is related to several academic disciplines involved in eLexicographic research such as linguistics, natural language processing (NLP), digital humanities, artificial intelligence (AI), computational linguistics, computer science, etc. This constitutes a challenge to provide professionals with training opportunities and ensure knowledge exchange among all stakeholders.</p>
			<p style="text-align:left; ">The workshop has three main aims: firstly, we will invite speakers from existing major lexicographic projects to give insights into the complexity in regard of data, technologies and community aspects of lexicography. Secondly, we will provide a hands-on tutorial with the ELEXIS infrastructure to enable participants to become familiar with the technologies being developed in the project. Finally, we will make an open call for posters, which will provide an overview of new projects in the area of electronic lexicography, with a special focus on papers that tackle the topic of complexity. The poster presenters will give a 5 minute lightning talk on their topic in addition to their contribution to the poster session.</p>

			<p style="text-align:left; ">Summary of the Call</p>
			<p style="text-align:left; ">We welcome submissions of abstracts of up to 500 words that will be presented as posters at the workshop. Submissions should present methodologies, experiments, use cases, descriptions of ongoing or planned research projects and position papers on topics related to the topics of interest (given above). Furthermore, we especially welcome papers describing interdisciplinary research combining research in lexicography, linguistics, computer science and digital humanities approaches and giving insights into complexity in regard of data, technologies and community aspects of lexicography. </p>
			<p style="text-align:left; ">Please submit abstracts by May 6th 2019 in any language (including an English translation for the title for reviewing purposes). Submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers and will be made available online prior to the workshop. Papers should be submitted via EasyChair. Notifications will be sent by end of May and final versions of abstracts will be required by end of June. More information on the workshop can be found on the
