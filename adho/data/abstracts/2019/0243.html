       This poster will present the cooperative and collaborative services defined
				by a French-Italian Digital Library (DL) founded on the principles of public
				engagement   <span id="ftn1_return">
					<a class="notelink" title="Public engagement is intended as “the myriad of ways in which the activity and benefits of higher education and research can be shared with the public…" href="#ftn1">
						<sup>1</sup>
					</a>
				</span>
       . Cooperation and collaboration are often confused with each other, but our
				experience leads us to distinguish them in order to better achieve the purpose of
				our project. </p>
			<p>We define a DL based on the public engagement model as a   <span style="font-weight:bold">participative DL</span>
       . Such a library offers a set
				of services that encourages expert and lay users to work together to enrich
				pre-existing content and disseminate their knowledge, all the while acquiring new
				skills. Public engagement within a DL can take different forms, defined by the ways
				users are encouraged to contribute. First, the public engagement can result in a
					  <span style="font-weight:bold">cooperative</span>
       participation. Users perform a
				task that helps the DL to enrich its collection, but during the realization of this
				task the DL in return passes on knowledge to them, as is done with the citizen
				sciences, such as the   <span style="font-style:italic">Old Weather</span>
       project
					  <span id="ftn2_return">
					<a class="notelink" title="https://www.oldweather.org" href="#ftn2">
						<sup>2</sup>
					</a>
				</span>
       . </p>
			<p>According to a cooperative model, only the results are mutualized (Misanchuk et
				Anderson 2001; Choi et Pak 2006; Kozar 2010); the DL defines the way users can
				contribute, that is to say in a way that can potentially benefit both library and
				users: the DL gains new content and the users, new skills.</p>
			<p>If cooperation is often the way of public engagement that is encountered in DLs, a
				second model is the one of   <span style="font-weight:bold">collaboration</span>
       .
				With this latter, the library and the users co-construct services and digital
				contents. It is the results   <span style="font-style:italic">and</span>
       the working
				process that are mutualized and shared among the participants (Hord 1981; Misanchuk
				et Anderson 2001; Choi et Pak 2006; Kozar 2010) – as seen in the   <span style="font-style:italic">The Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript</span>
				<span id="ftn3_return">
					<a class="notelink" title="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Devonshire_Manuscript" href="#ftn3">
						<sup>3</sup>
					</a>
				</span>
       or in many projects developed within the   <span style="font-style:italic">Cambridge University Digital Library</span>
				<span id="ftn4_return">
					<a class="notelink" title="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk" href="#ftn4">
						<sup>4</sup>
					</a>
				</span>
       . </p>
			<p>We have applied those principles to our DL, which aims at becoming a participative
				digital library, where the users are both readers and authors of the content they
				access. To define our participative services and to allow the coexistence of
				cooperation and collaboration within the same interface, we relied on an exhaustive
				state of the art of participative services in digital heritage projects and on the
				results of a user study (2016-2017). This user study took the form of a
				questionnaire (67 answers) and interviews (8 participants), centered on the
				behaviour of users on DLs, as well as on the notion of participation. The poster
				will focus on the collaborative and cooperative services we have chosen for   <span style="font-style:italic">Fonte Gaia</span>
       , thanks to this user study and this
				state of the art. </p>
			<p>Our   <span style="font-weight:bold">collaborative</span>
       services allow users to carry
				out digital projects focused on Italian studies, with the help of the DL managers:
				digital scholarly editions, edition of ebooks, creation of reading paths or digital
				exhibitions. The scholarly community behind our DL (Digital humanities scholars,
				philologists, librarians, computer scientists) supports users in the realization of
				their project, from the definition of common objectives and working methods to the
				publication on our DL. They work together at each stage of the project. </p>
			<p>These projects are carried out in the back-office of our DL, which is based on Omeka
				S   <span id="ftn5_return">
					<a class="notelink" title="https://omeka.org/s/" href="#ftn5">
						<sup>5</sup>
					</a>
				</span>
       . Some of these user-driven projects, such as virtual exhibitions, rely on
				standard tools (in the form of plugins). Others, such as digital editions, are
				currently developed using external tools, and simply linked to the DL. Collaboration
				thus leads to a diversification of user intervention spaces: users are not only
				associated with the front-end interface, but also with the back-end interface. </p>
			<p>At the same time, we have defined   <span style="font-weight:bold">cooperative</span>
      
				services, for instance the adding of tags, of bibliographical references or of
				comments, all of which performed in a controlled way. This will allow users to share
				their knowledge with others, while being initiated to a specific librarian skill.
				For instance, in the case of participatory indexing, we want the user to add
				keywords from controlled vocabularies: on one hand, it will ensure a harmonization
				of the contributions; on the other hand, it will initiate users to librarians’
				indexing methods and help them better understand the vocabularies used by
				librarians, in order to improve their further research on the DL. The contribution
				process of cooperative services is entirely defined by the DL: those services will
				therefore be only accessible to the users from the front-end interface. </p>
			<p style="text-align:left; ">The development of these services is ongoing and is itself
				based on a collaborative process. Most of the services are developed by our DL’s
				transdisciplinary team. Other services will benefit from a special treatment, such
				as the indexation, which will be the subject of a hackathon in March 2019. Through a
				hackathon, participants with varied professional backgrounds will experiment several
				solutions to design a cooperative service in line with the librarians’ missions, as
				well as with the principles of public engagement.</p>
