					<span class="head">Introduction</span>
				</h2>
				<p>Although there have been some infrastructural developments of late, the main
						  <span style="font-style:italic">modus operandi</span>
         in digital literary
					studies is still to apply a certain research method to an ephemeral corpus. In a
					best-case scenario, the results are   <span style="font-style:italic">somehow</span>
         reproducible, in a worst-case scenario they are not
					reproducible at all. At best, there is an openly accessible corpus in a standard
					format such as TEI, another markup language, or at least TXT. At worst, the
					corpus is not even accessible, i.e., the research results cannot be questioned. </p>
				<p>However, there are signs that this is slowly changing. Some projects provide
					interfaces that allow for multiple ways of access to corpora. One of these
					projects is DraCor, an open platform for research on (European) drama, which
					will be introduced in this paper (accessible at   <a class="link_ptr" href="https://dracor.org/">
						<span>https://dracor.org/</span>
					</a>
         or via its GitHub repositories or its API). DraCor transforms existing text
					collections into 'Programmable Corpora' – a new term we bring into play with
					this talk. </p>

						<span class="head">Vanilla Corpora</span>
					</h3>
					<p>Similar to the COST Action on European novels (Schöch et al. 2018), the
						DraCor project seeks to establish a bundle of multilingual drama corpora
						encoded in basic TEI as basis for digital comparative studies. To date, the
						platform enables access to a Russian-language (   <a class="link_ptr" href="https://dracor.org/rus">
							<span>https://dracor.org/rus</span>
						</a>
           ) and a German-language corpus of plays (   <a class="link_ptr" href="https://dracor.org/ger">
							<span>https://dracor.org/ger</span>
						</a>
           ). Similar to Paul Fièvre's collection "Théâtre classique", these
						corpora are designed as vanilla corpora, which initially contain hardly any
						special markup beyond the necessary, but are freely available and can
						therefore be forked, enriched and expanded. To demonstrate that other
						corpora can be easily linked to the platform, we forked the Shakespeare
						Folger Corpus and the Swedish Dramawebben corpus and connected it, and all
						existing extraction and visualisation methods of the platform are readily
						applicable to the newly added corpora (   <a class="link_ptr" href="https://dracor.org/shake">
							<span>https://dracor.org/shake</span>
						</a>
           and   <a class="link_ptr" href="https://dracor.org/swe">
							<span>https://dracor.org/swe</span>
						</a>
           ). Other corpora of dramatic texts are to follow; the only prerequisite
						is that they are encoded in TEI. </p>
					<p>The advantages of a freely available corpus hosted on GitHub are obvious. Not
						only can the corpus be cloned and loaded directly into an XML database like
						eXist-db. Using the SVN wrapper from GitHub, the entire corpus can also be
						downloaded directly, in its current state and without version history if
						this is not needed:</p>
					<p>svn export https://github.com/dracor-org/rusdracor/trunk/tei</p>
					<p>An openly accessible GitHub repository also means that pull requests for
						error correction are possible and welcome.</p>

					<h3 class="DH-Heading2">
						<span class="headingNumber">2.2. </span>
						<span class="head">XML Database (eXist-db) and Frontend</span>
					</h3>
					<p>DraCor relies on eXist as XML database to process TEI files and to provide
						functions for researching the corpora. The frontend is built with React (   <a class="link_ptr" href="https://reactjs.org/">
							<span>https://reactjs.org/</span>
						</a>
           ), it is responsive and easily extensible. However, the focus is not on
						the GUI, but on the API (on the general differences between these two
						approaches to interfaces cf. Bleier/Klug 2018). </p>
				</div>
				<div class="DH-Heading2" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.3">
					<h3 class="DH-Heading2">
						<span class="headingNumber">2.3. </span>
						<span class="head">API</span>
					</h3>
					<p>To come close to the ideal and the possibility of applying "all methods to
						all texts" in a simple manner (Frank/Ivanovic 2018), it takes more than open
						corpora. The article by Frank/Ivanovic advocates SPARQL endpoints (for which
						there is also a readily-available app for eXist-db:   <a class="link_ptr" href="https://github.com/ljo/exist-sparql">
							<span>https://github.com/ljo/exist-sparql</span>
						</a>
           ). </p>
					<p>DraCoroffers such endpoint, but also features a rich general API documented
						and explained via Swagger (   <a class="link_ptr" href="https://dracor.org/documentation/api/">
							<span>https://dracor.org/documentation/api/</span>
						</a>
           ). In a subarea of corpus philology, the digital scholarly editions,
						discussions about more proactive use of APIs have already begun (for
						background information cf. Bleier/Klug 2018), the Folger Digital Texts API
						may serve as an example (   <a class="link_ptr" href="https://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/api">
							<span>https://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/api</span>
						</a>
           ). The advantage of a more modern solution like Swagger is that API
						queries can be executed live and directly and that the output can be
						controlled more precisely. </p>
					<p>A simple use-case scenario would look like this: using RStudio you can throw
						a quick glance into a corpus with just a few lines of code, maybe regarding
						the development of the number of characters in Russian drama between 1740
						and 1940, stored in the metadata table (   <a class="link_ptr" href="https://dracor.org/api/corpora/rus/metadata">
							<span>https://dracor.org/api/corpora/rus/metadata</span>
						</a>
           ). This table, which can be obtained in JSON or CSV format, is read
						into a Data.Table, whereupon the values of two columns (year of publication
						and number of speakers) can simply be visualised via ggplot (Fig. 1). </p>
					<div class="figure">
						<img src="Pictures/613c829d238060ecb0e5547d121ab724.png" alt="Figure 1: Number of characters per play in chronological order (source: RusDraCor)." class="graphic" width="100%"/>
						<div class="caption">Figure 1. Figure 1: Number of characters per play in
							chronological order (source: RusDraCor).</div>
					</div>
					<p>This very simple example is able to show the starting point of a decisive
						structural diversification of the Russian drama landscape. Pushkin's
						historical drama "Boris Godunov" (1825), result of his reading of
						Shakespeare, features speech acts of 79 characters, a number previously
						unthinkable in Russia drama.</p>
					<p>However, the possibilities are not limited to using ready-made API functions.
						New research ideas always create new needs for easily obtainable and
						reproducible data and metrics; the API can be extended accordingly, i.e.,
						new research ideas can be implemented centrally in the API layer. This is
						made even easier by the fact that Apache Ant can be used to rebuild the
						entire development environment on your own system.</p>
					<p>In addition to structural data and metadata, full texts without markup can
						also be obtained, e.g., if methods such as stylometry or topic modelling are
						the purpose, i.e., methods that need a "bag of words" and do not require
						markup.</p>
					<p>All in all, the structure and documentation of open APIs makes it much easier
						to reproduce research results, which up to now has often been a
						time-consuming (or impossible) process.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="DH-Heading2" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.4">
					<h3 class="DH-Heading2">
						<span class="headingNumber">2.4. </span>
						<span class="head">Shiny App</span>
					</h3>
					<p>An example of the versatility of the DraCor API is the Shiny App created by
						Ivan Pozdniakov (   <a class="link_ptr" href="https://shiny.dracor.org/">
							<span>https://shiny.dracor.org/</span>
						</a>
           ). Shiny is a framework based on R, which makes it possible to display
						interactive visualisations in the browser. The DraCor Shiny App does just
						that, relying entirely on the DraCor API for data retrieval. Thus,
						visualisations of the current database can be used for teaching and research
						purposes, but also for easier data correction. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="DH-Heading2" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.5">
					<h3 class="DH-Heading2">
						<span class="headingNumber">2.5. </span>
						<span class="head">Didactics</span>
					</h3>
					<p>The formalisation of literary texts, for example via markup, is not
						self-explanatory. Although the community can rely on some standards, every
						operationalisation depends on the actual research question. To give an
						example: if you would like to extract network data based on character
						interactions in a literary text, you would have dozens of different ways of
						doing this (e.g., Grayson et al. 2016 test different extraction methods for
						novels and compare the results). This also applies to plays. In order to
						sharpen the senses for this in teaching, we developed the tool "ezlinavis" (
							  <a class="link_ptr" href="https://ezlinavis.dracor.org/">
							<span>https://ezlinavis.dracor.org/</span>
						</a>
           ) and integrated it into the DraCor toolchain. Network data can be
						extracted from literary texts manually, also to raise the awareness for the
						contingency of this process, an important preliminary step to the eventual
						step of operationalisation. </p>
					<p>In addition to an approach to the gamification of the process of correcting
						TEI-encoded corpora (Göbel/Meiners 2016), we also developed a card game for
						teaching purposes in order to playfully train the understanding of network
						values (Fischer at al. 2018).</p>
					<p>These didactic tools wrapped around the platform are an integral part of the
						whole project as they are based on the project data and operationalisations.
						While building the platform, it was important to recognise that data can
						take several forms and be equally important for research and teaching.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="DH-Heading2" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.6">
					<h3 class="DH-Heading2">
						<span class="headingNumber">2.6. </span>
						<span class="head">Linked Open Data</span>
					</h3>
					<p>The TEI files contain GND [Integrated Authority File of the German National
						Library] and Wikidata identifiers for both authors and works. In this way,
						various data and facts that lie beyond one's own corpus work can be
						included. Something like an automatically created gallery of authors has a
						more illustrative character (de la Iglesia/Fischer 2016). But using the same
						identifiers, we can also determine if a corpus has a regional bias. Via
						Wikidata, we can easily display the distribution of the authors' places of
						birth and death on a map (by doing so, we could rule out that our
						German-language corpus GerDraCor has a regional bias, cf. Göbel/Fischer
						2015).</p>
					<p>Similarly, the Wikidata ID of the plays can be used to find out where they
						were first performed (example query:   <a class="link_ptr" href="http://tinyurl.com/y9vga68j">
							<span>http://tinyurl.com/y9vga68j</span>
						</a>
           ), i.e., aspects of the performance history can be switched on, even
						though they are not the focus of the core project and based on data curated
						elsewhere. </p>

					<h3 class="DH-Heading2">
						<span class="headingNumber">2.7. </span>
						<span class="head">Infrastructure Instead of Rapid Prototyping</span>
					</h3>
					<p>Projects like DraCor seek to provide the digital literary studies with a
						reliable and extensible infrastructure so that the research community can
						focus on research questions.</p>
					<p>An important conclusion for us was that we would give up the further
						development of our all-in-one Python script collection "dramavis"
						(Kittel/Fischer 2014–2018 and Fischer et al. 2017), which we have been
						developing for four years now. From here on, we would rather devote our time
						to the API. "Dramavis" followed the idea of rapid prototyping and had to do
						all by itself, including the preprocessing of data (Trilcke/Fischer 2018),
						which is not untypical in the Digital Humanities. The code base has grown
						quite a bit in the meantime and its maintenance has become difficult and
						often enough led away from actual research questions.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="DH-Heading1" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3">
				<h2 class="DH-Heading1">
					<span class="headingNumber">3. </span>
					<span class="head">Outlook</span>
				</h2>
				<p>In allusion to the project "ProgrammableWeb" – which maintains a database of open
					APIs and whose slogan is: "APIs, Mashups and the Web as Platform" (accessible at
						  <a class="link_ptr" href="https://www.programmableweb.com/">
						<span>https://www.programmableweb.com/</span>
					</a>
         ) – we propose the term 'Programmable Corpora' for research-oriented
					corpora providing an API. </p>
				<p>Programmable Corpora facilitate the implemention of research questions around
					corpora. It is to be expected that infrastructural efforts of this kind will pay
					off for the entire community with effects such as those listed by John Womersley
					in his presentation at the ICRI2018 conference in Vienna: a) dramatically
					increase scientific reach; b) address research questions of long duration
					requiring pooled effort; c) promote collaboration, interdisciplinarity,
					interaction.</p>
				<p>The are numerous ways to connect to Programmable Corpora, no matter if you don't
					want to code at all and only need a CSV file for Excel or LibreOffice Calc or a
					GEXF file for Gephi, if you want to research a corpus via its connections to the
					Linked Open Data cloud or just want to get specific data for your R or Python
					script without having to worry about the corpus and its maintenance and
					reproducibility (all this remains an option, though). Programmable Corpora make
					it easier to decide on which level of the platform your own research process
					starts.</p>
