					<span class="head">Introduction</span>
				</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">This workshop will allow DH practitioners to exchange experiences in DH education, and to voice and explore ideas and hopes for the near future. The topic of education is explored, firstly, from the perspective of the pedagogies for DH practices and, secondly, regarding the ways in which DH resources facilitate learning via digital means across broader society. The workshop seeks to create a forum that brings together DH practitioners with specialists in educational sciences and digital innovation. The workshop is open to anyone who is involved or interested in the creation of educational resources in DH. The organisers have made a special effort to include specialists from outside the DH community with expertise in educational sciences and digital innovation. The outcome of this workshop is primarily one of community building, whereby DH practitioners interested in pedagogy can discuss ways to move forward in the near future and to potentially consider the idea of composing a shared strategic agenda on this topic.</p>

				<h2 class="DH-Heading1">
					<span class="headingNumber">2. </span>
					<span class="head">Background</span>
				</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">Well over half a century since the beginning of computational approaches to the humanities, digital methods have become more and more embedded in the academic establishment. The primary outputs of much DH work are of course the digital editions, archives, libraries, databases and various tools that, among other purposes, can act as educational resources for the humanities. Additionally, Digital Humanities provides pedagogical resources for its practitioners in an abundant multitude of forms. A clear example of this extreme diversity is the 
            <span style="font-style:italic">Digital Humanities Course Registry</span>
        
         maintained by DARIAH and CLARIN (2014). This list is one example of attempts currently underway to bring this complex web of educational resources into some sort of manageable form, further examples include the online learning platform 
            <span style="font-style:italic">dariahTeach</span>
        
         (DARIAH, 2017) and the MLA's 
            <span style="font-style:italic">Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities</span>
        
         (Davis et al, 2015).
      </p>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">It comes as no surprise that such a vast array of educational resources have been developed in DH. The community is characterised by its high level of interdisciplinarity, its commitment to digital innovation and experimentation, and a strong DIY mentality. However, it might also be fair to say that the approach to pedagogy in the creation of such digital tools has been largely ad-hoc. The valuable efforts after-the-fact to map the complex web of educational materials mentioned above opens up the question of what DH would look like with more shared and planned pedagogical strategies.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left; ">Over the last two years a conglomeration of all research universities and universities of applied sciences in the Netherlands drew up and agreed upon what was called the 
            <span style="font-style:italic">Acceleration Plan for Educational Innovation with ICT</span>
        
         (VSNU et al, 2018). This four-year plan identifies eight areas in which Dutch universities could benefit from a shared approach to educational innovation on a national level. These include transitioning to digital open teaching aids and materials; and evidence-based educational innovation with ICT. Sessions in this workshop will focus on both the question of ‘openness’ in DH educational resources and the extent to which pedagogical approaches can be seen as evidence-based. Using this strategic plan as a focal point and inspiration for DH, the workshop asks the question: If we innovate together strategically, using open and evidence-based approaches, can we achieve more as a community in DH education?

				<p style="text-align:left; ">Topics of the workshop include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>

					<h3 class="DH-Heading2">
						<span class="headingNumber">3.1. </span>
						<span class="head">DH pedagogy in practice</span>
					</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left; ">We intend to take stock of existing types of DH educational resources, course materials and pedagogical approaches, focusing largely on the question of how DH practitioners develop their skill sets and on the resources that are available to them. On what grounds can a selection of necessary skills be made, working towards establishing foundational DH skills? At the same time, can we successfully deal with the persistent view that one needs to know ‘everything’, from traditional humanities to computer science skills? Furthermore, we consider the pedagogical strategies that are being implemented to teach DH skills to students. This includes identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the current status quo, and looking at the possibility to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching through an evidence-based discussion. Topics may include (but are not limited to): </p>

						<li class="item">DH methodologies</li>

					<h3 class="DH-Heading2">
						<span class="headingNumber">3.2. </span>
						<span class="head">Open Education</span>
					</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left; ">This topic explores the question of openness in DH educational resources both from an educational sciences perspective and from the experience of developing and running open DH education in practice. </p>
					<div class="DH-Heading3" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.2_div.1">
						<h4 class="DH-Heading3">
							<span class="headingNumber">3.2.1. </span>
							<span class="head">What does ‘open’ mean in the context of Digital Humanities education? </span>
						</h4>
						<p style="text-align:left; ">The term ‘open’ has been applied to a wide variety of contexts, including government, science, data and education. The increased use of the term ‘open’ has made its meaning become increasingly ambiguous, which could also lead to misinterpretation and unrealistic expectations in terms of outcomes (Kalz, 2014). In other words, ‘open’ often means different things to different social actors, confirming an early statement of Hyland (1979) who described the field as ‘eclectic’. In this part of the session we will address the term in its multiple formulations, zoom in on the aspects that could be of relevance to Digital Humanities education and discuss some of the implications.</p>

					<div class="DH-Heading3" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.2_div.2">
						<h4 class="DH-Heading3">
							<span class="headingNumber">3.2.2. </span>
							<span class="head">MOOCs in DH</span>
						</h4>
						<p style="text-align:left; ">There are increasing numbers of MOOCs being developed by the DH community. Recent examples include those available by the 
                <span style="font-style:italic">dariahTeach</span>
            
             platform, which provides courses on introducing DH, TEI encoding, digital scholarly editions, digitisation and multimodal literacies. Many of the MOOCs from the DH community are developed with a certain consideration and awareness of good pedagogical practices, to the extent that there even exists a meta-MOOC or a MOOC on MOOCs (Stommel, 2012). This part of the session will include guest speaker(s) that have been recently involved in the development and implementation of a MOOC in DH to discuss their experience about this format and engage in debate around the theories of open educational resources.

						<span class="headingNumber">3.3. </span>
						<span class="head">Agenda for innovation</span>
					</h3>
					<p style="text-align:left; ">The focus of this topic is to identify potential shared strategies for the future of DH Education. The aforementioned Dutch Acceleration Plan for Innovation in Education with ICT will form one of the focal points and will be discussed in more detail both on a conceptual and content level as an exercise in strategic thinking. By doing this, the aim is to explore if this kind of method could be applied to DH and what that might look like, in other words, how to practically formulate a shared strategy for DH education.</p>
					<p style="text-align:left; ">It will raise a number of questions for debate, such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="item">Can we assemble a shared set of key desiderata for innovation in DH education?</li>
						<li class="item">How can we move towards evidence-based innovation in education?</li>
						<li class="item">Can we promote a structured rather than ad-hoc approach to developing learning resources, do we need to keep it disruptive, or can some sort of balance be found, and how?</li>
