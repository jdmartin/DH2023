				<span>With the earliest printed map of Boston appearing only in 1722,
          visualizing the early history of the city has been a challenge for centuries. The
          collaborative project, “</span>
				<a class="link_ref" href="https://mollynebiolo.com/digital-humanities/the-birth-of-boston/1648-map/">
					<span>The Birth of Boston</span>
				</a>
				<span>” is an online GIS map of seventeenth-century Boston’s
          residents and major civic infrastructure. This project extends the work of Samuel Chester
          Clough, an early-twentieth-century cartographer who spent the last decades of his life
          producing an unpublished atlas of Boston’s residents before 1800, and Annie Haven Thwing,
          an amateur historian who produced almost fifty thousand index cards with the demographic,
          social, and legal histories of early Bostonians.</span>

			<p>
				<span>The creation of this project stemmed from the lack of resources
          on Boston’s colonial history for undergraduate students to interact with during an early
          American history course last fall. Christopher Parsons, the creator of this project, began
          researching the presence of pre-Revolutionary Boston history at the Massachusetts
          Historical Society and came across the rich collections of Clough and Thwing. With
          Nebiolo’s experience in the graduate certificate program for DH at Northeastern, and from
          funding through the NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks and the Boston Research Center, we
          were able to generate a preliminary site depicting Boston’s social and spatial history in
          1648.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet “The Birth of Boston” is just in its early stages of
          digital work. Clough’s papers include maps of the entire city with numbered parcels and
          ownership information for the additional years of 1633, 1638, 1676, 1722, and 1798. Our
          hope is to digitize the 1633 and 1638 maps and use the online versions of the others to
          provide a digital time-lapse of Boston’s early urban history, with the potential to extend
          the project into the 19</span>

			<p>By presenting the work at DH2019, we hope to discuss with attendees how to best standardize
        the data and presentation of the project as it grows over the next few years, and whether
        our creation of the tool is useful and engaging. The project provides space at the
        conference for debate around best practices for digital colonial map projects and pedagogy
        for seventeenth century data resources like this one. </p>
			<p>The poster is organized around the key questions, decisions, and objectives made for the
        creation of “The Birth of Boston” 1648 map. Some of these questions include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li class="item">What exists on Boston’s early colonial history?</li>
				<li class="item">How can this history be best presented for an audience?</li>
				<li class="item">What platforms should be used?</li>
				<li class="item">How should we present that data?</li>
				<li class="item">How can we incorporate the histories of other populations that were present
          in Boston, such as indigenous communities, slaves, and freed slaves? </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Information on the dataset produced from the citizen data in the Thwing collection are
        present on the poster. We will also provide visitors the opportunity to interact with the
        map with a laptop. </p>
			<p>The overall goals of “The Birth of Boston” poster presentation is to provide another
        example of how the field of early modern history can benefit from the methods of DH and how
        it can strengthen projects that focus on producing an educational, historical narrative for
        a public audience. </p>
