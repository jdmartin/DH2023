				<span>This poster will present our digital reading approach to body language in fiction. We use the web application CLiC – Corpus Linguistics in Context (freely available at clic.bham.ac.uk) and a range of corpus linguistic methods to identify gendered patterns of body language in literature for children. We are particularly interested in how the presentation of body language has changed over time and how the changes we identify reflect socially structured and gendered patterns of behaviour. We therefore work with two different data sets: the ChiLit corpus - a corpus of 19th century children’s literature (4.4 million words) and a corpus of contemporary children’s literature - i.e. texts published after 2000 drawn from the </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">Oxford Children’s Corpus </span>
				<span>(12.9 million words)</span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>
				<span>We use 5-grams (also referred to as ‘clusters’ in the corpus linguistic literature) to identify candidates for body language clusters (cf. Mahlberg, 2013). We specifically select clusters that contain nouns referring to body parts (e.g. </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">hands, eyes</span>
				<span>), bodily functions (e.g. </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">breath</span>
				<span>) or pieces and parts of clothing (e.g. </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">pockets</span>
				<span>). Focusing on 43 clusters we identify trends of diachronic development in body language descriptions.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We both find clusters that seem to no longer play a significant role in contemporary data (e.g. </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">looked up in his face</span>
				<span>) as well as emerging clusters, such as </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">got to his feet and </span>
				<span>or </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">a hand on his shoulder.</span>
				<span> We also compare differences between body language clusters that tend to occur with male or female characters. For this comparison, we draw on the occurrence of personal and possessive pronouns (</span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">he, she, his, him, her</span>
				<span>) that serve as an approximation to calculate the overall population of male and female characters in the texts under investigation. In line with other relevant literature confirming gender imbalance in fiction (e.g. Underwood et al., 2018), we only found one typically “female” cluster: </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">her hands on her hips. </span>
				<span>Our findings further show, for instance, that </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">head </span>
				<span>as a body part seems to be typical of clusters that tend to occur more frequently, or even exclusively, with male characters, e.g. </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">the back of his head </span>
				<span>and </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">his head in his hands </span>
				<span>are such “male” clusters in both corpora. Examples like </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">his head in his hands </span>
				<span>have corresponding female clusters (</span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">her head in her hands</span>
				<span>) with similar frequencies in the 19th century texts, while in contemporary data the “male” variant is more frequent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Examples of typically “male” clusters in ChiLit contain the word </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">pocket</span>
				<span>: </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">his hands in his pockets </span>
				<span>and </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">put it in his pocket. </span>
				<span>In the contemporary data, these clusters still do not figure often with female characters, but at least pockets do get mentioned: the cluster </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">out of his/her pocket and </span>
				<span>is an example that is found for both genders. There are two other typically male clusters: </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">his eyes fixed on the </span>
				<span>(both in ChiLit and the contemporary data) and the emerging cluster </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">the corner of his eye. </span>
				<span>Other clusters that include the plural form </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">eyes</span>
				<span> also start off occurring with both male and female characters in ChiLit but then undergo a shift towards ‘maleness’. We found one cluster, </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">with tears in his/her eyes, </span>
				<span>for which a shift from female to more general – less gendered – usage can be identified. Importantly, a detailed analysis reveals how different usages of clusters are linked to changes in social contexts.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This poster will not only show gendered patterns of body language, it also demonstrates how corpus linguistic methods contribute to wider concerns in digital humanities. Corpus linguistic methods link literary and linguistic analysis through the computer-assisted study of patterns in texts. The poster contributes to a broader area of research within corpus stylistics, cf. Ruano San Segundo’s (2018) investigation into gendered patterns of reporting verbs in Charles Dickens or Čermáková and Mahlberg’s (2018) study of gendered speech in Carroll’s </span>
				<span style="font-style:italic">Alice in Wonderland.</span>
