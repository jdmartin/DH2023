				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</p>
			<p> In the digitization era, documents provided by historical archives are at prompt disposal
        of digital humanities researchers that could directly employ them in text mining analyses.
        However, the high degree of textual variability and domain specificity of such materials
        pose several methodological and technical issues for scholars aiming to automatically
        extract information from historical collections (Sporleder, 2010, Van Hooland et al., 2013,
        Ehrmann et al., 2016). This abstract reports on a recently concluded project that developed
        a system for extracting events, participants and their roles from a digitized corpus of
        Italian memoirs of Resistance members during the Second World War. In particular, in our
        work we have adopted and adapted resources, techniques and tools from research literature in
        information extraction to provide advanced semantic access to the collection. We chose
        events as structural concept for extracting and representing textual information as they
        offer a “natural” pivot, keeping together semantic information at different levels (type of
        the event, time, space, role of the involved entities). We are also encouraged on this way
        by the findings of a recent work (Sprugnoli and Tonelli, 2017), which suggested, inter alia,
        the necessity to expand the inventory of event types (compared to existing annotation
        schemas like ACE, ERE (Aguilar et al., 2014) or TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2005)).</p>

      The textual dataset is composed of 25 digitized memoirs of Italian partisans. Since our
        pipeline relies upon a pattern-based method for the initial event extraction, we integrate
        the resource with two other subcorpora on the same topic, obtained from the web: all texts
        in the Italian Wikipedia category “World War II Resistance movements”     <span id="ftn1_return">
					<a class="notelink" title="" href="#ftn1">
						<sup>1</sup>
					</a>
				</span>
      
       and a set of biographies of Italian partisans from Wikisource     <span id="ftn2_return">
					<a class="notelink" title="" href="#ftn2">
						<sup>2</sup>
					</a>
				</span>
      
      . In addition, three more books have been digitized that compose the “Memoirs-test”
        subcorpus and are used for evaluation. </p>

      The methodology developed in our project combines Named Entity Disambiguation (NED),
        Semantic Tagging and Role Labeling: as a first step, frame-like event patterns are collected
        across the whole corpus. Given the domain at hand (war memoirs), we mainly focus on
        movements of persons and artifacts, conflictual events and events related to organizations. </p>

			</div>
			<p> The event extraction pipeline consists of two macro-steps: first, NED is performed against
        a set of three gazetteers of Persons, Places and Organizations; also, all non-named entities
        (nouns) are tagged with semantic classes (Figure 1) by means of a semantic tagger based on
        word embeddings. </p>

				</a>
      
       The output of this first stage is then used as input for a pattern matching algorithm
        that, based on a previously collected dictionary of lexico-semantic patterns of argument
        structures, extracts event mentions from text, classifies them into discrete classes and
        assigns the detected participants a role with respect to the event itself. The pattern
        dictionary built for the purpose counts 246 lexical units, i.e., event-denoting lemmas: 124
        verbs, 77 nouns and 45 multi-word verbal expressions; such lexical units map overall to 88
        Event Classes, where the relationship between lexical units and event classes is
        many-to-many. The system is designed to separate high and low confidence event mentions
        based on the number of correctly labeled arguments. A detalied account of the adopted
        methodology can be found in Rovera et al., 2018. </p>

				<h2>Evaluation</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				<a id="id_docs-internal-guid-05b1a92e-7fff-995f-d3f3-139d6aac79ab">
					<!--anchor-->
				</a>
      
       The evaluation of the system is performed on a set of 300 manually annotated sentences
        taken from the “Memoirs-test” corpus, which has not been used for collecting patterns. In
        particular, we evaluate the performance of the system for a) event detection, where we
        achieve .78 Precision and .50 Recall, and b) in event classification, where we score .73
        Precision (.89 where only high confidence events are taken into account). </p>

				</a>
      
      In order to display the extracted information, we represent events, participants and
        roles as a network. Events and entities are represented as nodes (labeled with class and
        type, respectively) linked by edges, each labeled with the role that the entity plays in the
        correspondent event. </p>

       The linking of a relevant number of named entities enables a rich visual representation
        (Figure 2) of the extracted knowledge, along with the capability to build queries based
        either on a specific entity, on a class of events, or on a more complex combination of
        roles, events and entities. </p>
			<h2> Conclusion </h2>
			<p> By presenting our work at the conference we hope to foster the use of event, participants
        and roles for obtaining a semantically advanced access to historical corpora. </p>
