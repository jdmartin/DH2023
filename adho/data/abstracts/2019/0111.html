			<p>The CITE Architecture is a generic framework for identification, retrieval, and alignment
        of information about things humanists study. The challenge of a   <span style="font-weight:bold">generic</span>
       framework lies in how it can handle the
        (literally) innumerable specific kinds of data likely to appear in any non-trivial digital
        library. CITE allows abstraction of data from specific encodings of that data, while
        maintaining   <span style="font-weight:bold">scholarly identity</span>
      . This allows a digital
        library an open-ended ability to incorporate new formats or retrieval methods in a
        self-documenting plain-text serialization that maintains backwards compatibility. This paper
        will describe the implementation of   <span style="font-weight:bold">Discoverable Data
          Models</span>
       and   <span style="font-weight:bold">Extended Text Property Types</span>
      
        serialized in the CEX format and implemented in applications. Specific examples will be ( a
        ) geo-spatial data, in which a place can be represented by a URI to a gazetteer, a
        latitude/longitude pair, or a geoJson string, ( b ) textual data represented as plain-text,
        Markdown, or as a TEI-XML fragment, and ( c ) image collections, where the same image may be
        exposed as a JPG on a filesystem, via the IIIF-API, or as a DeepZoom file. CEX, the
        plain-text exchange format, can serialize collections and allow an application or service to
        discover these extended types or ignore them gracefully. All tools and data for these
        examples will be downloadable from GitHub. </p>
			<p class="heading 4">Citation of Versioned Collections</p>
			<p>The acronym in the title of the CITE Architecture stands for Collections, Indices, Texts,
        and Extensions. ‘Texts’ are CTS-compliant texts, that is, texts canonically citable with
        machine-actionable CTS URNs because they implement the OHCO2 model, “an ordered hierarchy of
        citation objects.”(Smith and Weaver) ‘Indices’ are simple URN to URN relationships,
        subject-verb-object relationships akin to RDF triples, with the proviso that subject, verb,
        and object are canonically citable by machine-actionable URNs. ‘Collections’ are of data
        objects and may be ordered or unordered.</p>
			<p>The CITE Architecture allows collections of objects to be cited at many levels of
        abstraction and specificity.</p>
			<p>
				<span style="font-family:Menlo">urn:cite2:botcar:catesbySpecimen:</span>
       A citation to a
        notional collection of of botanical specimens collected by Mark Catesby. </p>
			<p>
				<span style="font-family:Menlo">urn:cite2:botcar:catesbySpecimen.2018:</span>
       A citation to
        a specific version of a collection of of botanical specimens collected by Mark Catesby. </p>
			<p>
				<span style="font-family:Menlo">urn:cite2:botcar:catesbySpecimen.2018:223</span>
       A citation
        to a specific specimen in a specific version of the collection. </p>
			<p>
				<span style="font-family:Menlo">urn:cite2:botcar:catesbySpecimen:223</span>
       A citation to a
        specific specimen in   <span style="font-style:italic">any</span>
       version of the collection.
        This recognizes that the   <span style="font-style:italic">specimen</span>
       is an object of
        study that might have different expressions in data. </p>
			<p>A version of a CITE Collection is defined by its properties and their values. Each property
        is citable by URN:</p>
			<p>
				<span style="font-family:Menlo">urn:cite2:botcar:catesbySpecimen.2018.label:</span>
       The
            <span style="font-family:Menlo">label</span>
       property in a specific version of a
        collection. </p>
			<p>
				<span style="font-family:Menlo">urn:cite2:botcar:catesbySpecimen.2018.binomial:</span>
       The
            <span style="font-family:Menlo">binomial</span>
       property in a specific version of a
        collection. </p>
			<p>An notional object is instantiated in a versioned collection by the sum of properties and
        their values:</p>
			<p>
				<span style="font-family:Menlo">urn:cite2:botcar:catesbySpecimen.2018.label:223</span>
       The
            <span style="font-family:Menlo">label</span>
       property for object   <span style="font-family:Menlo">223</span>
       in a specific version of a collection. </p>
			<p>
				<span style="font-family:Menlo">urn:cite2:botcar:catesbySpecimen.2018.binomial:223</span>
      
        The   <span style="font-family:Menlo">binomial</span>
       property for object   <span style="font-family:Menlo">223</span>
       in a specific version of a collection. </p>
			<p>Two versions of a notional collection need not have the same properties.</p>
			<p>Properties are   <span style="font-style:italic">typed</span>
      , at a very low level. CITE
        defines valid types as: </p>
			<p class="List Paragraph">String (optionally with a controlled vocabulary)</p>
			<p class="List Paragraph">Boolean</p>
			<p class="List Paragraph">Number</p>
			<p class="List Paragraph">Cite2Urn</p>
			<p class="List Paragraph">CtsUrn</p>
			<p class="heading 4">Compositions of Scholarly Primitives</p>
			<p>The CITE Architecture defines   <span style="font-weight:bold">scholarly primitives</span>
      :
        texts, or objects in versioned collections. Objects in versioned collections consist of a
        set of typed properties, with a very limited number of types. </p>
			<p>This makes the CITE Architecture flexible and relatively simple: libraries for working with
        two types of URN, libraries for manipulating corpora of texts, and libraries for dealing
        with objects in collections, libraries for managing relations of URN to URN.</p>
			<p>All CITE data—texts, objects, and relations—can be expressed in plain text, and CEX, the
        Cite Exchange format, can serialize a digital library, or a part of a digital library, as
        plain text. CITE-aware services or applications can load data from CEX.   <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/">
					<span style="color:3262B2">the Homer Multitext’s interactive web-application</span>
				</a>
      , the   <a class="link_ref" href="http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/hmt/hmt-microservice/">
					<span style="color:3262B2">Homer Multitext’s microservice</span>
				</a>
       and   <a class="link_ref" href="http://folio.furman.edu/cite.html">
					<span style="color:3262B2">more specific applications exposing digital libraries for
            teaching</span>
				</a>
      , all read CEX files as their input. </p>
			<p class="heading 4">Extensions I: Connecting to the Physical World</p>
			<p>The ‘E’ in CITE is “Extensions”, additional discoverable information providing richer
        interaction with the basic scholarly primitives.</p>
			<p>A CITE Collection can describe a collection of images. A very basic image collection might
        have the properties   <span style="font-family:Menlo">label</span>
      ,   <span style="font-family:Menlo">license</span>
      , and   <span style="font-family:Menlo">caption</span>
      . </p>
			<p>Clearly, while we can serialize this information easily as plain-text in CEX, resolving a
        URN to binary image data requires a connection to the physical world. A notional ‘image’
        might be resolved to a JPG file, to data delivered by the IIIF API, to a DeepZoom file, or
        to any combination of these.</p>
			<p>CITE and CEX solve this problem by means of “discoverable data models”, additional data
        (expressed as generic CITE collections) that can identify specific collections of images as
        being served by one or more binary image services. In this case, an additional Binary Image
        Service collection associates a collection with:</p>
			<p>A type of image service (JPG file, IIIF-API, DeepZoom)</p>
			<p>A URL to a service hosting images from the collection</p>
			<p>Filepath information necessary to resolve an image’s URN to files on the server.</p>
			<p>A working example of this is   <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:vaimg.2017a:VA304VN_0806">
					<span style="color:3262B2">the Homer Multitext’s interactive web-application</span>
				</a>
      . The   <a class="link_ref" href="https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-archive/blob/master/releases-cex/hmt-2018e.cex">
					<span style="color:3262B2">CEX of the HMT’s data release</span>
				</a>
       identifies image collections as being expose both as DeepZoom files and via the
        IIIF-API. The web-application takes advantage of both of these to provide thumbnail views
        and interactive zooming views. </p>
			<p class="heading 4">Extensions II: Different Expressions of Textual Data</p>
			<p>An object in a version of a collection might have a property of type   <span style="font-family:Menlo">string</span>
      , and that is easily discoverable with the basic
        CITE tools. But of course, a   <span style="font-family:Menlo">string</span>
       might be plain
        text, Markdown, some form of XML, or some other encoding. It is easy to imagine a project
        publishing a version of a collection of comments as plain-text, and subsequently publishing
        a new version that adds some markup to those comments. </p>
			<p>Because the CITE2 URN allows identification of notional collections, versioned collections,
        individual properties in versioned collections, in each case across the collection or
        filtered by an object’s identifier, we can expose additional information about the nature of
        a property of type   <span style="font-family:Menlo">string</span>
      . </p>
			<p>By means of a discoverable data model, just as we associated whole collections of images
        with different binary image services, we can associate properties with different encodings,
        without losing scholarly identity. This paper will demonstrate a notional Collection of
        comments on the text of Herodotus, expressed in three different versions: one with comments
        in plain-text, one with comments formatted as Markdown, and one with comments formatted as
        TEI-XML fragements. These   <span style="font-style:italic">discoverable extended string
          property types</span>
       are ignored by any application that is unaware of them, but
        exploited for human display by applications that are aware of them. </p>
			<p>As a working example of   <span style="font-weight:bold">discoverable extended string
          property types</span>
      , we can point to a CITE Library of lexicon data, based on the openly
        licensed XML versions of the   <a class="link_ref" href="http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/index.html">
					<span style="color:3262B2">Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek Lexicon</span>
				</a>
      , the   <a class="link_ref" href="http://folio2.furman.edu/lewis-short/index.html">
					<span style="color:3262B2">Lewis &amp; Short Latin Dictionary</span>
				</a>
      , and   <a class="link_ref" href="http://folio2.furman.edu/strong/">
					<span style="color:3262B2">Strong’s Hebrew Lexicon</span>
				</a>
      . Data for each of these serialized in a CEX file, and served through a Microservice.
        Querying the service shows that the lexicon entries, of type   <span style="font-family:Menlo">StringType</span>
       can be read as plain-text:   <a class="link_ref" href="http://folio2.furman.edu/lex/objects/urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n2389">
					<span style="color:3262B2">http://folio2.furman.edu/lex/objects/urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n2389</span>
				</a>
      . But because this collection identifies that property as extended by   <span style="font-family:Menlo">Markdown</span>
      , an aware application can process the plain-text
        expression and apply formatting:   <a class="link_ref" href="http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/index.html?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n2389">
					<span style="color:3262B2">http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/index.html?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n2389</span>
				</a>
      . </p>
			<p class="heading 4">Extensions III: Different Expressions of Real World Data</p>
			<p>Digital Gazetteers such as the Pleiades project[^pleiades] have solved the problem of
        scholarly identity across historically diverse placenames, so ‘Naulochon’, ‘Smyrna’, and
        ‘Izmir’, different names for the same place, are canonically citable as   <span style="font-family:Menlo">https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/550771</span>
      . But for very
        sound technological reasons, we might want to express the location of Izmir by   <span style="font-family:Menlo">550771</span>
      , by its full Pleiades URI, by   <span style="font-family:Menlo">38.440912, 27.14781</span>
      , by   <span style="font-family:Menlo">27.14781, 38.440912</span>
      , by   <span style="font-family:Menlo">{"type":
          "FeatureCollection", "features": [{"type": "Feature", "properties": {}, "geometry":
          {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [27.14781, 38.440912 ] } } ] }</span>
      , or by   <span style="font-family:Menlo">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;&lt;kml
          xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2"&gt;&lt;Document&gt;&lt;Placemark&gt;&lt;ExtendedData&gt;&lt;/ExtendedData&gt;&lt;Point&gt;&lt;coordinates&gt;27.14781,38.440912&lt;/coordinates&gt;&lt;/Point&gt;&lt;/Placemark&gt;&lt;/Document&gt;&lt;/kml&gt;</span>
      . </p>
			<p>A collection of, for example, “ancient places mentioned in Herodotus”, as a publication
        should separate the notional scholarly objects—'Sardis', ‘Athens'—from any particular
        technology for locating those objects on a map. The CITE extended string property types
        allows different versions of such a collection to record locations in any of a variety of
        formats, or to mix formats within a single expression,   <span style="font-style:italic">e.g.</span>
       latitude and longitude for a simple point, with geoJson for describing
        regions. The presentation will include a demonstration dataset illustrating this. </p>
			<p class="heading 4">Conclusion</p>
			<p>CEX, as a line-based, plain-text serialization of diverse data—texts, collections,
        relations—is a convenient, future-proof, and open means of data exchange for small projects
        and large project. ( The   <span style="font-style:italic">Homer Multitext</span>
       2018g
        release is published as a 73,000 line CEX file. ) With   <span style="font-weight:bold">discoverable-data-models</span>
       and   <span style="font-weight:bold">extended-text-property-types</span>
      , CEX can serve data in a variety of current and
        future formats; these formats are discoverable by applications that, but degrade gracefully
        back to generic, plain-text in generic CITE applications. The talk will point to example CEX
        files and applications, on GitHub, demonstrating these capabilities with scholarly data. </p>
