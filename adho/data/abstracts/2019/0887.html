					<em> During the elaboration of his political theory, the materialist philosopher Thomas
            Hobbes (1588-1679) developed a complex relation with the Bible. Although he credited
            himself with the scientific foundation of politics, in The Elements of Law (1640), De
            Cive (1642, 1647), and the English and Latin Leviathan (1651, 1668), Hobbes made an
            increasing use of Scriptural evidence in support of his arguments. While fighting
            Scholastic philosophy on its own ground, not only did he lay the foundations of modern
            Biblical criticism, but he also provided a markedly heterodox interpretation of a
            growing number of Scriptural passages.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>And yet, the hundreds of Biblical quotations sprinkled in the political writings,
            Hobbes’s simultaneous use of multiple Scriptural sources and his inconsistent handling
            of the source-texts make it hard to account for the nature and development of Hobbes’s
            treatment of the Bible.    <br/>
          
           That is why, with the notable exception of the pioneering
            study by Harold W. Jones (Jones, 1984), even modern scholarship has rarely dared to
            venture in a methodical examination of Hobbes’s Biblical knowledge and exegesis (Pacchi
            et al., 1988; Somos, 2015).</em>

					<em>With this poster, we aim to showcase the benefits of a textometric approach to what
            Jones defined “the problem of Hobbes and the Bible”. We draw on pilot evidence from the
            ongoing Digital Theological Hobbes project, where textometric functionalities are put in
            the service of the study of Hobbes’s Biblical discussions thanks to a TXM-based corpus
            of diplomatic transcriptions of the English political works. Based on the preliminary
            results obtained from the exploitation of the prototype corpus, we argue that the unique
            combination of automatic and semi-automatic tools of the TXM software platform     <a class="link_ptr" href="http://textometrie.ens-lyon.fr/?lang=en">http://textometrie.ens-lyon.fr/?lang=en</a>

            following milestones:</em>

					<em>Our first results are the following:</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em> 1) the TXM-based prototype corpus of diplomatic transcriptions of Hobbes’s English
            political works, built by linguistically annotating, refining and importing the XML-TEI
            P5-encoded (TEI Consortium, 2019) EEBO-TCP transcriptions (Kichuk, 2007) of Human
            Nature, De Corpore Politico, Philosophicall Rudiments concerning Government and Society
            and Leviathan (freely accessible at     <a class="link_ref" href="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership/Texts">https://github.com/textcreationpartnership</a>

            specificities) analysis tools;</em>

            quotations” (Jones, 1984: 274), see Figs. 1 and 2; </em>

						<em>Conclusion </em>
					</span>
				</h2>
				<p>
					<em>By shedding new light on Hobbes’s knowledge, use and handling of the Scriptures over
            time, we will take a fundamental step forward in accomplishing Jones’s research agenda.
            However, we will also make a methodological contribution to many historical humanities.
            The textometric analysis of Hobbes’s exegetical practices will actually allow the
            development of a computational approach to the study of Biblical reception that could be
            applied to many modern textual corpora.</em>
